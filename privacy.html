                    <P>
                        CommentBox.io is a hosted commenting platform. Our platform is comprised of
                        Services that include a website at <A href="https://commentbox.io/">https://commentbox.io/</A> ("The Website"), a
                        dashboard application at <A href="https://dashboard.commentbox.io/">https://dashboard.commentbox.io/</A>
                        ("The Dashboard"), and an embedded commenting plugin at <A href="https://github.com/forward-motion/commentbox.io">https://github.com/forward-motion/commentbox.io</A>
                        ("The Plugin").

                    <P>
                        Our philosophy is one of friendliness, transparency, and responsibility, and
                        we have designed our Services around these ideals. We hope that you enjoy using
                        our Services, and that in building a platform that respects users, our users
                        will in turn reciprocate that respect towards our Services.

                        The overall privacy mandate of CommentBox.io is to never collect more data
                        than we require to run our collective services, and for only as much time as we
                        require it. Our mission is to provide you with high quality service, and to do
                        so with minimal data collection, processing, or intrusion. We have no interest
                        in any personal data or data generated by our users, other than what is
                        necessary to deliver our services. We aim for full transparency on how we
                        gather, use, and share your personal information and other data.

                        The data we collect on The Website are for analytics purposes only. We not
                        use any 3rd party analytics (such as Google Analytics).

                    <P>
                        However, we do engage in 1st party analytics, by parsing the server logs of

                        Website. This method does not use any cookies or other forms of tracking. Here

                        The only purpose of collecting server log data is to count visitors to The
                        Website. We do this in a transparent fashion using the following script: <A href="https://github.com/forward-motion/commentbox.io-analytics">https://github.com/forward-motion/commentbox.io-analytics</A>.

                    <P>
                        Of particular note is that we respect the Do Not Track setting in browsers,
                        and we also hash visitors' IP addresses with a secret key.

                        We won't utilize collected data for any purpose except for what was described
                        above. We also have no mechanisms in place for linking this data with any other
                        datasets. Particularly, we have no way of associating IP address with user
                        accounts of our dashboard or plugin. We also have no way of tracking users
                        across websites, besides the "referer" HTTP header sent to us by your
                        browser.

                        Access log files are automatically deleted after approximately 30 days. Our

                        Unfortunately, your IP address and referer will tend to show up on server

                    <P>
                        We offer social login options with Facebook, Twitter, and Google, as well as
                        logging in via email. All login methods are offered via Firebase Auth, and all
                        require collecting your email address and name. If using social login, we will
                        receive this data from your 3rd party account (e.g. from your Facebook or
                        Twitter account). If using email login, you will be asked to provide this data
                        yourself.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Note that we do not collect or utilize any other 3rd party data, including
                        your Facebook ID, Twitter ID, or google ID. The only data we collect and utilize
                        are your email address and name.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Before logging in, you may opt to uncheck "remember me", which discards your
                        session if you close your browser/browser tab. Keeping "remember me" checked
                        allows us to save your login status into local storage (not cookies). Note,
                        however, that the third party services that you may choose to log in with can
                        utilize their own cookies or other mechanisms to save your login status on their
                        domain, resulting in you not having to re-type your credentials. We do not have
                        control over this, and normally this is the desired behavior, however we do
                        offer the option to "re-authenticate", meaning we prompt third party login
                        windows to allow you to re-enter your credentials.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Secondly, we collect credit card information via Stripe, when you are asked
                        to provide it to us. This information is saved securely via Stripe's front-end
                        plugins, without ever touching our front-end or back-end code.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Thirdly, we do not track analytics on The Dashboard. This includes the
                        first-party analytics method installed on The Website.
                    </P>
                    <H3 id="what-we-use-collected-data-for-">What we use collected data for.</H3>
                    <P>
                        We use your email address to uniquely identify you, even across multiple
                        login methods.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Secondly, we use your email to associate your dashboard user account to your
                        plugin user account, as these user accounts are separate.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Thirdly, we associate your name, email address, and credit card information
                        with a Stripe customer that we create to represent your user account in Stripe.
                        Your email address may be used directly by Stripe when attempting to send you
                        transactional emails about payment-related activity.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Fourthly, we use your email to send you transactional email via SparkPost or
                        Firebase Auth, based on various explicit opt-in actions. For example, setting up
                        a new project will prompt you to clearly mark which email notifications you wish
                        to receive.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Fifthly, we use your name to refer to you whenever a name is required, either
                        in emails or on The Dashboard front-end.
                    </P>

                    <P>
                        We'll never send you any marketing emails or product announcements. We don't
                        put your email address into any subscriber lists of any sort. The only emails we
                        send are transactional in nature.
                    </P>
                    <H3 id="what-3rd-parties-have-access-to-collected-data-">
                        What 3rd parties have
                        access to collected data.

                    <P>
                        We leverage Firebase Auth for login, SparkPost for sending transactional
                        emails, and Stripe for payments. All three parties have access to both your
                        email address and display name.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Secondly, Firebase Auth has access to general data regarding your social
                        login, however we do not use this data.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Thirdly, Stripe has access to your credit card details, however we do not
                        have direct access to these details.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Fourthly, data we save related to your projects or project comments are saved
                        in Google Cloud Datastore (in a U.S. based datacenter), The Dashboard's primary
                        database.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Fifthly, your project comments may be saved in Algolia (also in a U.S. based
                        datacenter) if you've subscribed to a pricing plan that includes search, which
                        allows you to search through these comments.
                    </P>
                    <H3 id="how-long-collected-data-is-retained-">

                    <P>
                        Since all of the data we collect is essential to The Dashboard's operation,
                        we retain it all indefinitely, with the exception of Algolia comments, which
                        have an expiration time of 90 days.
                    </P>
                    <H3 id="how-you-can-remove-data-collected-from-you-">
                        How you can remove data

                    <P>
                        With the exception of your Stripe customer account, you are able to delete
                        all of your data via The Dashboard. You may delete individual project data in
                        each project's "danger zone", or you may delete your entire account and related
                        data in the account section's "danger zone".
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        If you delete your account, this also deletes all of your projects and
                        related project data. This includes all data stored in Firebase Auth, Google
                        Cloud Datastore, and Algolia. The only data we retain is your Stripe customer
                        account, which is necessary for accounting and to adhere to the law in some
                        countries.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Note that deleting your dashboard account does not delete your plugin user
                        account, which is separate.

                        What kinds of data we collect,
                        and how.
                    </H3>
                    <P>
                        We offer social login options with Facebook, Twitter, and Google, as well as
                        logging in via email. All login methods are offered via Firebase Auth, and all
                        require collecting your email address and name. If using social login, we will
                        receive this data from your 3rd party account (e.g. from your Facebook or
                        Twitter account). If using email login, you will be asked to provide this data
                        yourself.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Secondly, with social login, we also collect your profile photo from your 3rd
                        party account. We do not collect this data when using email login.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Note that we do not collect or utilize any other 3rd party data, including
                        your Facebook ID, Twitter ID, or google ID. The only data we collect and utilize
                        are your email address, name, and photo.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Before logging in, you may opt to uncheck "remember me", which discards your
                        session if you close your browser/browser tab. Keeping "remember me" checked
                        allows us to save your login status into local storage (not cookies). Note,
                        however, that the third party services that you may choose to log in with can
                        utilize their own cookies or local storage to save your login status on their
                        domain, resulting in you not having to re-type your credentials. We do not have
                        control over this, and normally this is the desired behavior, however we do
                        offer the option to "re-authenticate", meaning we prompt third party login
                        windows to allow you to re-enter your credentials.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Thirdly, we collect the project ID and URL of The Website that The Plugin is
                        installed on. This data is then associated to any comments made, for the purpose
                        of linking back to that comment.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Fourthly, we of course collect the comments, votes, flags, and any other
                        explicit actions you perform whilst interacting with The Plugin.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Fifthly, The Plugin does not use any 3rd party analytics (such as Google
                        Analytics). However, we do retain and utilize access log data, but not for the
                        same analytics purposes as The Website. Instead, we use this data in order to
                        bill our customers by their usage, by parsing the server logs of requests made
                        by The Plugin. This method does not use any cookies or other forms of tracking.
                        Here is a list of exactly the fields that we collect: <A href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-logs#format">https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-logs#format</A>.
                        Also, unlike The Website, we do not use the IP address or referer fields. The
                        only relevant fields are the ones that help us determine which action was taken
                        (e.g. creating a comment or downloading comments). We are not concerned with who
                        performed the action. This data is then sent to and aggregated by Stripe for
                        billing purposes.
                    </P>
                    <H3 id="what-we-use-collected-data-for-">What we use collected data for.</H3>
                    <P>
                        We use your email address to uniquely identify you, even across multiple
                        login methods. Your email address is never exposed publicly to other plugin
                        users or dashboard users, but your user ID, name, and photo are. When posting a
                        comment, you may choose to post anonymously, which hides your user ID, name, and
                        photo from all users, including dashboard users. Comments made anonymously also
                        do not show up in your comment history.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        You should expect that any comment you create will become public, and will at
                        the very least be seen by a moderator.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Secondly, we use your email to associate your dashboard user account to your
                        plugin user account, as these user accounts are separate. This is necessary to
                        determine which plugin users are moderators.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Thirdly, we use your email to send you transactional email via SparkPost or
                        Firebase Auth, based on various explicit opt-in actions. For example, when
                        posting a comment, you may opt-in to receive email notifications about replies
                        to your comment.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Fourthly, we use your name to refer to you whenever a name is required,
                        either in emails or on The Plugin's front-end.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Fifthly, we use the project ID and website URL that plugin is installed on in
                        order to link back to any comments made while on that website.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Sixthly, we use the server log data in order to accurately count usage and
                        bill our customers accordingly.
                    </P>
                    <H3 id="what-we-won-t-use-collected-data-for-">
                        What we won't use collected data
                        for.
                    </H3>
                    <P>
                        We'll never send you any marketing emails or product announcements. We don't
                        put your email address into any subscriber lists of any sort. The only emails we
                        send are transactional in nature. We also don't use any data (including comment
                        data, websites users comment on, etc.) in order to build "profiles" of users,
                        analyze their habits, or attempt to track users across websites. Even users'
                        comment histories are limited to The Website that their history is currently
                        being viewed on.
                    </P>
                    <H3 id="what-3rd-parties-have-access-to-collected-data-">
                        What 3rd parties have
                        access to collected data.
                    </H3>
                    <P>
                        We leverage Firebase Auth for login and SparkPost for sending transactional
                        emails. Both parties have access to both your email address and name. Firebase
                        Auth has access to general data regarding your social login, however we do not
                        use this data.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Data related to comments made, votes cast, or any other explicit user action
                        is saved in a combination of Google Cloud Storage, Google Cloud Datastore, and
                        Firebase Firestore, all of which are located in U.S. datacenters.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Additionally, user comments may be saved in Algolia (also in a U.S. based
                        datacenter) if the project is subscribed to a plan that includes search, which
                        allows project moderators to search through these comments.
                    </P>
                    <H3 id="how-long-collected-data-is-retained-">
                        How long collected data is

                    </H3>
                    <P>
                        Since all of the data we collect is essential to The Plugin's operation, we
                        retain it all indefinitely, with the exception of Algolia comments, which have
                        an expiration time of 90 days, and server logs, which are retained for 180 days,
                        for payment auditing purposes.

                    <P>
                        You may delete your plugin account from the "danger zone" in the user profile
                        section of The Plugin. Deleting your account also removes all of your data,
                        including comments, votes, preferences, etc. This includes all data stored in
                        Firebase Auth, Google Cloud Storage, Google Cloud Datastore, Firebase Firestore,
                        and Algolia.

                        Our Services are offered worldwide, but the majority of our datacenters are
                        located in the United States. As such, the information about you that we process
                        when you use the Services in the EU will be used, stored, and/or accessed by
                        individuals operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us,
                        other members of our group of companies, or third party data processors. This is
                        required for the purposes listed in the relevant sections above. When providing
                        information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate
                        measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information
                        adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law.
                        These measures include:
